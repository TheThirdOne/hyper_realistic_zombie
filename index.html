<h1> Hyper Realistic Zombies </h1>
<hr>
<h2> Intro </h2>
<p> This is a game that brings a new sense of realism to the genre of zombie games. It makes fighting more realistic by, for example, 
having a clip count and requiring players to relode their clips. It also has a complicated health system with a very slow regen. As a result of
the realism, the game is incredibly hard.
