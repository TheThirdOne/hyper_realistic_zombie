hyper_realistic_zombie
======================

A zombie apocalypse game that will be stunningly accurate to what we know about zombies. This includes weapons, reloading, carrying capacity, food, and sleep. It will involve a complex skill hierarchy that is customized based on what the player does (like Skyrim). It will be a free reign game with randomly generated maps. It might be a real-time game that uses notifications to alarm you of developments.
